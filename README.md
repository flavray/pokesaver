# Installation

Open `pokesaver.saver`, OS X will do the rest

# Future work

There are a couple of improvements I have in mind.
Feel free to send pull requests if you want to contribute!

* Read background and character from a JSON configuration file (images, background matrix, animations, …)
* Add configuration settings using ScreenSaverDefaults (animation speed, …)
* More?
